<h2>Dual To-Do Modes:</h2>
<pre>Daily Tasks: Tasks reset daily, with a cool "Task Status" system and a gamified score to keep you motivated.

Normal Tasks: A flexible list where tasks persist until you decide otherwise (yes, even that one task you've been ignoring for weeks).</pre>
<br>

<h2>Core Functionalities:</h2>
<pre>Add Tasks: Enter new tasks with ease.

Delete Tasks: Clean up the list when you're done (or when you realize you've overcommitted).

Modify Tasks: Change your mind? Update tasks anytime.

Swap Tasks: Rearrange tasks because order matters (sometimes).

Clear All Tasks: Start fresh with the press of a button (careful, there's no "undo").</pre>
<br>

<h2>Built-In File Handling:</h2>
<pre>Stores tasks in local files (data.txt and dailydata.txt) for persistence.

Metadata (like dates, status, and scores) managed in metadata.txt. A personal assistant in file form.</pre>
<br>

<h2>Gamified Daily Tasks:</h2>
<pre>Mark tasks as "done" and earn points!

Score resets if you miss a day (motivation, or mild anxietyâ€”you decide).</pre>
<br>

<h2>Automatic File Setup:</h2>
<pre>Automatically creates required files if missing. Even your code likes to stay organized</pre>
<br>

<h2>Behind the Scenes:</h2>
<pre>Uses C++ STL (<fstream>, <vector>, <ctime>, <cstdlib>) for file handling and user-friendly operations.

Console clearing magic with system("cls"). Works on Windowsâ€”Linux/macOS users, swap with system("clear").</pre>
<br>

<h2>Acknowledgments ðŸ™Œ</h2>
<pre>"It's very simple to make todo list.. so lame", this is what everyone said but,"How can we make it work completely and with some fun?", is what my mind said.</pre>
