<h2>Dual To-Do Modes:</h2>
<pre>Daily Tasks: Tasks reset daily, with a cool "Task Status" system and a gamified score to keep you motivated.

Normal Tasks: A flexible list where tasks persist until you decide otherwise along with deadline management now.

(Deadlines won't help you if you dont open this application daily, so do open it daily, lazy people!)</pre>
<br>

<h2>Core Functionalities:</h2>
<pre>Add Tasks: Because who doesnâ€™t love adding more to their plate?
  
Delete Tasks: Like a magician, make tasks disappear (poof!).

Edit Tasks: Change your mind? No problem! Just edit away.

Daily and Normal Tasks: Keep your life organized like a well-sorted sock drawer with deadline for your tasks.

Task Status: Know when youâ€™ve conquered your tasks (or when theyâ€™ve conquered you).

Deadline Management: Because we all know deadlines are just necessaryâ€¦ right?</pre>
<br>

<h2>Built-In File Handling:</h2>
<pre>Stores tasks in local files (data.txt and dailydata.txt) for persistence.

Metadata (like dates, status, scores and deadlines) managed in metadata.txt. A personal assistant in file form.</pre>
<br>

<h2>Gamified Daily Tasks:</h2>
<pre>Mark tasks as "done" and earn points!

Score resets if you miss a day (motivation, or mild anxietyâ€”you decide).</pre>
<br>

<h2>Automatic File Setup:</h2>
<pre>Automatically creates required files if missing. Even your code likes to stay organized</pre>
<br>

<h2>Behind the Scenes:</h2>
<pre>Uses C++ STL (<fstream>, <vector>, <ctime>, <cstdlib>) for file handling and user-friendly operations.

Console clearing magic with system("cls"). Works on Windowsâ€”Linux/macOS users, swap with system("clear").</pre>
